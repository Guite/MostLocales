# ModuleStudio Localisation

This repository collects translations of the ModuleStudio application including
contained artifacts like the user manual, welcome pages and cheatsheets.

There are two folders in this repository:

  * bundles - locale bundles used by the application
  * features - locale features used by the application
  * translations - translation packs in several languages

Translators must only care for *translations*.
