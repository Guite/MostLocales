# ModuleStudio Localisation

This repository collects translations of the ModuleStudio application including
contained artifacts like the user manual, welcome pages and cheatsheets.

There are the following folders in this repository:

  * `bundles` - locale bundles used by the application
  * `features` - locale features used by the application
  * `releng` - artifacts for release engineering
  * `translations` - translation packs in several languages

Translators must only care for `translations`.
